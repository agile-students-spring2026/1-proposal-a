## Project Title

**Restrooms ToGo!**  
A location-based restroom ranking and discovery application.

## What and Why?

This project proposes building a software system that provides a ranked list of public and semi-public restrooms across different locations, such as New York City. Many people—especially students, tourists, and commuters—often struggle to find clean and accessible restrooms when they are outside their homes. For example, students looking for cafés to study in or tourists exploring unfamiliar neighborhoods frequently encounter this problem.

The system aims to solve this issue by aggregating restroom information and ranking restrooms based on user-selected criteria such as cleanliness, smell, and comfort level. The application will rely on map services and third-party APIs to obtain location data and contextual information (such as the names and descriptions of nearby restaurants or venues). This is important because the usefulness of the app depends on accurate, up-to-date information sourced from existing platforms rather than manually maintained data.

## For Whom?

This software is designed for real, identifiable users, specifically:

- Students, especially those who study in cafés, libraries, or other public spaces
- Tourists who are navigating unfamiliar cities and neighborhoods

These users are people like us—individuals who regularly move around the city and need quick access to reliable restroom information. Understanding their needs and ideally speaking with some of them during development will help refine the design and determine whether the system is successful by the end of the semester.

## How?

From an end-user’s perspective, the system will work as follows:

- The app requests access to the user’s current location or allows the user to enter a destination (for example, Manhattan).
- The system displays a ranked list of nearby restrooms within the selected area.
- Users can choose ranking criteria such as cleanliness, smell, and comfort level.
- Based on the selected criteria, the system generates different rankings and links to detailed pages for each restroom, including location information and nearby amenities.

The emphasis is on clarity and ease of use, without requiring users to understand the technical implementation behind the system.

## Scope

This project is appropriately scoped for a team of approximately **4–6 programmers** to complete within one semester. It is not too easy, as it involves integrating multiple APIs (such as mapping and location-based services), managing user preferences, and implementing dynamic ranking logic. At the same time, it is not overly ambitious because the core functionality—finding and ranking restrooms—is clearly defined and limited in scope. Additional features, such as discovering nearby food options, can be treated as optional extensions rather than core requirements, keeping the project manageable.
